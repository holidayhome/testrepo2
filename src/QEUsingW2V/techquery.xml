<title> Hubble Telescope Achievements </title>

<desc> Description: 
Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it
was launched in 1991.
</desc>
<narr> Narrative: 
Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced 
new data, better quality data than previously available, data that 
has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led
to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents
limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  
Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without 
reference to positive achievements would not be relevant.

<title> New Hydroelectric Projects </title>

<desc> Description: 
Identify hydroelectric projects proposed or under construction by
country and location.  Detailed description of nature, extent,
purpose, problems, and consequences is desirable.
</desc>
<narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents would contain as a minimum a clear statement 
that a hydroelectric project is planned or construction is under 
way and the location of the project.  Renovation of existing
facilities would be judged not relevant unless plans call for a
significant increase in acre-feet or reservoir or a marked change
in the environmental impact of the project.  Arguments for and
against proposed projects are relevant as long as they are supported 
by specifics, including as a minimum the name or location of the
project.  A statement that an individual or organization is for or
against such projects in general would not be relevant.  Proposals
or projects underway to dismantle existing facilities or drain
existing reservoirs are not relevant, nor are articles reporting a
decision to drop a proposed plan.

<title> Radio Waves and Brain Cancer </title>

<desc> Description: 
Evidence that radio waves from radio towers or car phones affect
brain cancer occurrence.
</desc>
<narr> Narrative: 
Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using
car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument 
rages regarding the direct association of one with the other.
The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by
some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A 
relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical 
study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain 
cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a 
radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the 
general population.

commercial applications such as Maglev flywheels 
for cars.  Discussions of superconductivity when
linked to Maglev and government support plans when 
linked to Maglev are also relevant.

<title> Undersea Fiber Optic Cable </title>

<desc> Description: 
Fiber optic link around the globe (Flag) will be
the world's longest undersea fiber optic cable.
Who's involved and how extensive is the technology
on this system.  What problems exist?
</desc> 
<narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents will reference companies involved
in building the system or the technology needed for
such an endeavor.  Of relevance also would be information
on the link up points of FLAG or landing sites or 
interconnection with other telecommunication cables.
Relevant documents may reference any regulatory problems
with the system once constructed.  A non-relevant 
document would contain information on other fiber optic
systems currently in place.

<title> Export Controls Cryptography </title>

<desc> Description: 
Determine the usefulness and effectiveness of 
continuing to maintain export controls on 
encryption software.
</desc> 
<narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents will argue for or against
continuing to make encryption software subject to
export controls.  Since 1993 quality encryption 
software to ensure the secrecy of communications
has been available, but the U.S. Government has 
considered such software to be subject to the same
export controls as munitions, and has sought to 
restrict the export of encryption software unless 
it contains a device which could allow the U.S. to
read the underlying messages.  Business interests 
say that this will make it impossible for U.S. producers
to compete in the international market.

<title> Abuses of E-Mail </title>

<desc> Description: 
The availability of E-mail to many people through their
job or school affiliation has allowed for many efficiencies
in communications but also has provided the opportunity for
abuses.  What steps have been taken world-wide by those 
bearing the cost of E-mail to prevent excesses?
</desc>
<narr> Narrative: 
To be relevant, a document will concern dissatisfaction by 
an entity paying for the cost of electronic mail.  Particularly
sought are items which relate to system users (such as employees)
who abuse the system by engaging in communications of the type
not related to the payer's desired use of the system.

with computer terminals on a daily basis?
</desc> 
<narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents would contain any information that 
expands on any physical disorder/problems that may be
associated with the daily working with computer terminals.
Such things as carpel tunnel, cataracts, and fatigue have 
been said to be associated, but how widespread are these or
other problems and what is being done to alleviate any
health problems.
